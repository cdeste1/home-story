## Why Home Story Is a Game-Changer

Closing a home sale is messy. Paperwork, warranties, receipts, appliance info—it piles up. Agents spend hours tracking it all, and new owners are left scrambling.  

**Home Story fixes all of that.**

- 📱 **Everything in One Place:** Transform a home's documents, warranties, paint colors, and appliances into a single clean digital transfer folder.
- ⏱️ **Save Time:** No more hunting through cabinets or email threads. Generate a professional PDF in minutes.

- 💼 **Professional Branding:** Your name, brokerage, and logo automatically included, making you look sharp and trustworthy.
- 🔒 **Secure & Controlled:** Unlock homes individually, or subscribe for unlimited access to all your listings.
- 💸 **Flexible Pricing:** $50 per home for occasional listings, or $400/year for unlimited homes—designed to scale with your business.
